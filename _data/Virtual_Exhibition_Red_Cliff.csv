The hand scroll of Wen Zhengming after Zhao Bosu’s Latter Prose-poem on Red Cliff features rich and vivid colours as well as simple and clear outlines.The depiction of the landscape is similar to Zhao Mengfu's blue-and-green literati painting tradition. An inscription by Wen Jia, a son of Wen Zhengming, describes the narrative behind this artwork towards the conclusion of the scroll. It describes how Wen Zhengming created this replica of Zhao Bosu's ""Latter Ode on the Red Cliff"" to save the original from being confiscated by a local official who wanted to deliver it to Yan Shifan, son of the powerful Grand Secretary Yan Song (1480-1567). This reproduction also exhibits Wen Zhengming's exceptional ability to imitate the style of antique paintings.

image2,image2.jpg,Former Prose-Poem on the Red Cliff,Li Song,Southern Song Dynasty (960~1279),"fan, ink and color on silk. In this fan painting, Li Song adopts a diagonal composition, only a corner of the Red Cliff at the top right of the picture is shown, so it is impossible to see its majestic momentum that was depicted in the prose-poem. The boat on Su Shi is located near the reef at the bottom left of the picture. The water on the river surface is turbulent, and the fine brushwork depicting water patterns show various dynamic movements, which suggests a sense that the drifting boat in the turbulent river can no long control of its own direction, hinting on the autobiographic aspect  of Su Shi’s personal and political life.
